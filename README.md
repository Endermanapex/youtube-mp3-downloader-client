# YouTube mp3 downloader
(again, no name idea sorry ðŸ‘¼)

A small website made mainly as an excuse to test [Mercure](https://mercure.rocks) and 
communication between a PHP process in a async message using [Messenger](https://github.com/symfony/messenger) 
and a **NodeJS** process (the CLI that converts the YouTube video into an MP3), then
it's uploaded to **Amazon S3**

## The CLI
The CLI used to make the conversion is a small CLI I've made specifically for this projet. 
It is available here: [https://github.com/Liinkiing/ytomp3](https://github.com/Liinkiing/ytomp3)

## Special thanks
- [@itsleath](https://github.com/itsleath) for the beautiful design â¬›
