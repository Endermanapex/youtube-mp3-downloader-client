# YouTube mp3 downloader
[https://ytomp3.vercel.app/](https://ytomp3.vercel.app/) (again, no name idea sorry ðŸ‘¼)

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/unknownblueguy6/MineSweeper)](https://repl.it/github/endermanapex/youtube-mp3-downloader-client)

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

A small website made mainly as an excuse to test [Mercure](https://mercure.rocks) and 
communication between a PHP process in a async message using [Messenger](https://github.com/symfony/messenger) 
and a **NodeJS** process (the CLI that converts the YouTube video into an MP3), then
it's uploaded to **Amazon S3**

## âš  Read this
If the website is slow to respond to any of your conversion request, it is either because 
my **free** heroku Dynos are waking up, or because another process is already in use. 
Because I'm using only the free dynos in Heroku, I have just one free worker process, 
so it can handle just one process at a time, so yeah it scales **VERY POORLY** (don't want 
to pay actually because it was more of a hobby side project than a real thing)


## The CLI
The CLI used to make the conversion is a small CLI I've made specifically for this projet. 
It is available here: [https://github.com/Liinkiing/ytomp3](https://github.com/Liinkiing/ytomp3)

## The backend
If you wanna see the backend (a **Symfony 5** powered back-end), go here : [https://github.com/Liinkiing/youtube-mp3-downloader-api](https://github.com/Liinkiing/youtube-mp3-downloader-api)
